# 📊 Data Visualization and Statistics Using Python

## 🧑‍🏫 Project Info
- **Title:** Data Visualization and Statistics Using Python  
- **Dataset:** Diabetes Dataset  

## 📌 Visualizations
1. **Correlation Matrix (Heatmap):**  
   - Shows relationships between features.  
   - **Finding:** BloodPressure and BMI are moderately correlated, indicating a connection between higher blood pressure and BMI.  
   - The 'Outcome' variable has weak correlations with other features.  

2. **Scatter Plot (BloodPressure vs BMI):**  
   - Displays a positive relationship between BloodPressure and BMI.  
   - Suggests that higher BMI correlates with higher blood pressure.  

3. **Distribution Plots (Pregnancies, SkinThickness, Age):**  
   - Pregnancies: skewed distribution, with few people having many pregnancies.  
   - SkinThickness: concentrated at lower values.  
   - Age: more evenly distributed.  

4. **Pie Chart (Outcome):**  
   - Shows imbalance in the dataset.  
   - More people do not have diabetes compared to those who do.  

5. **Boxplots (SkinThickness, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, BloodPressure):**  
   - Highlight outliers, particularly in BloodPressure and SkinThickness.

## 📊 Data Statistics
- **Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode):**  
  - Most features have close mean and median values → relatively normal distributions.  
  - Mode identifies the most frequent values.  

- **Dispersion (Standard Deviation, Min, Max):**  
  - SkinThickness and BloodPressure → high variability.  
  - Age and Pregnancies → lower variability.

## ✅ Conclusion
### Key Findings
1. **BloodPressure and BMI are positively correlated** → relevant to diabetes risk.  
2. The dataset shows **class imbalance** → more non-diabetic individuals than diabetic.  
3. Some features contain **outliers** (e.g., BloodPressure, SkinThickness) → may require further cleaning.
